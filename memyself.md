- 👋 Hi, I’m @SerahSim
- 👀 I’m interested in Linguistics and Data Science. I love to work on dialects and gathering typos of any kinds of languages including programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lingusitics and Data Science in University of California, Berkeley located in California, United States.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my personal project which I have been brainstorming; dialect interpretor. With this, I ultimately want to build a huge database of dialects of every possible languages to preserve the sounds and words for the future from extinction.
- 📫 How to reach me: IG@serahsim or EMAIL: serahsim@berkeley.edu
